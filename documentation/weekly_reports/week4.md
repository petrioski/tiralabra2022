# Week 4

I added unittests, learned to use mock library to test user input and proper function behaviour. Using mocks was first very challengin and took more time than expected and did not have enough time to add more functionality to Markov chains (different levels). On the other hand, now the test coverage is above 90%. I added new code comments docstrings and for style checking I continued to use flake8.

Time used this week approximately 15 hours.
