# Week 2

Studied more about possibilities to do course project about investment related portfolio optimization. Although the topic was interesting, it seemed too much work to do to get familiared to the topic and keep up with course schedule. So in the end I decided to go with option b and changed topic to rock, paper and scissors game.

This week I planned and coded the first version of the game. The basic functionality is in place with preliminary testing and code coverage reports. The markov chain algorithm can be added to ai class, which is now just a random generator. I also drafted few initial docstrings and for style checking I have used flake8

Time used this week approximately 15 hours.

No immediate issues in sight and next task is to start implement the algorithmic core functionality.
