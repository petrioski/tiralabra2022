# Week 3

This week I implemented first draft of the markov chain algorithm. The principle works, but transforming it to probabilities and then adding different levels or memory parameters is currently the biggest challenge.

I added unittests, new comments docstrings and for style checking I continued to use flake8.

Time used this week approximately 15 hours.
