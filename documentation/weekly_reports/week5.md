# Week 5

This week I added improved generalisation of markov chains so that they can be used in multiAi setting and with different levels (length of past moves is definable by parameters). Also, added tests verifying that algorithm works correctly and chooces always move with highest probability. This week some working hours were allocated to peer review.

Time used 12 hours.
