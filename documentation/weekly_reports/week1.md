# Week 1

This week I've set up the git and python virtual environment ready for the project. I have also familiarized myself with different possible topic. So far financial time series forecasting feels interesting topic. I would need counseling with outlining the final project scope and techniques. Next Monday I'll reach out to course instructor to discuss details. Then I'm ready to start programming.
