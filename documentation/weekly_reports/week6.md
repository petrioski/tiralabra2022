# Week 6

This week I implemented improved looping for user to continue playing game, instead of program exiting after one game. Also, user parametrization for game settings was added and option for simulated gaming in computer vs. computer mode. User can define which Markov chain level AI uses. I also added more algorithm logic or performance tests to compare how different Markov chain levels perform against each others.

Time used 15 hours.
