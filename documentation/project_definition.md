# Project definition

First option is to utilize one or more machine learning techniques to time series forecasting (which ever fits the  course requirements best). For example, application could be using historical stock prices and try to predict how it moves next with LSTM and SVM. Both have delivered good results in time series forecasting (Parmezan et al., 2019)

Second option, if the first is not possible to tailor to course needs, is to develope AI for rock, paper scissor games.

The project will use Python as programming language and english as documentation language.

The project is part of my Computer Science Bachelor studies in University of Helsinki.
